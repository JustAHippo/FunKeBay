# FunKeBay
An eBay bid sniper written with Selenium!

# Usage
Move chromedriver.exe to your path(only tested on windows but ur free to try elsewhere)

Mandatory: Modify username, password, itemurl, and bidprice values

Optional: earlysecs(finetuned to my testing but you can change it), manual_sign_in(if my implementation of auto sign in doesn't work, use this and once you reach the main page, press enter in the command window)
